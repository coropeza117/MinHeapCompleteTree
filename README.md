# MinHeapCompleteTree

-Project Overview

A min-heap is a specialized tree-based data structure where the parent node is guaranteed to have a value less than or equal to its child nodes, making it ideal for tasks that involve maintaining the smallest (or highest priority) element at the root.

• Complete Tree ADT

The foundation of this project is the CompleteTree ADT (Abstract Data Type), which provides a generic interface for working with complete trees. This interface includes methods for accessing the size of the tree, obtaining references to the root and last elements, adding new elements, and removing elements from the tree. Additionally, the CompleteTree.Location interface defines methods for retrieving and modifying elements at specific locations within the tree.

• ArrayCompleteTree

One implementation of the CompleteTree interface is the ArrayCompleteTree, which represents the complete tree using a dynamic array. This approach offers a compact representation and efficient operations for min-heap construction. Elements are stored in the array in a specific order to maintain the properties of a min-heap.

• TreeCompleteTree

The second implementation, TreeCompleteTree, represents the complete tree as an interconnected tree structure of nodes. While this representation makes it easier to navigate parent and child relationships, it poses unique challenges for locating specific nodes within the tree.

• MinHeap Implementation

Building upon the CompleteTree implementations, we have created a MinHeap class that efficiently maintains the min-heap property. It incorporates the necessary algorithms for adding elements to the heap and removing the minimum element while ensuring that the min-heap properties are preserved.

• Accomplishments

Since its completion, the MinHeapCompleteTree project has achieved several key milestones:

    Robust Data Structures: The project provides two distinct implementations of the CompleteTree ADT, allowing users to choose the representation that best suits their specific needs.

    Efficient Min-Heap Operations: The MinHeap class efficiently maintains a min-heap over the underlying CompleteTree, enabling quick addition and removal of elements with minimal disruption to the data structure.

    Thorough Testing: The project includes a comprehensive suite of tests, covering ADT compliance, exhaustive scenarios, random testing, and efficiency testing. These tests ensure the correctness and reliability of the implemented data structures and algorithms.

    Invariants and Reliability: The code includes invariants and checks to maintain the integrity of the data structures, enhancing the reliability of the implemented classes.

    Educational Value: The project's documentation and comments aim to educate users on min-heaps, complete trees, and related algorithms. It serves as an educational resource for those learning about data structures and algorithms.
